h2. Foo

.p foo
* hey
* there

.p bar

This should be inside a paragraph.

<pre>
Will this mess things up?
</pre>

This should also be inside a paragraph:
* testing
* foo

Here's a nested list.
* blah
** blah
*** blah

Here's one that has a colon before it:
* blah
** blah
* blah
** blah

p. foo.

Foo

Blah:

This should have
line breaks.

Foo:
bar

1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + ... + 10<sup>2</sup>
